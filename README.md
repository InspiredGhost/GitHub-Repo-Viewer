# GitHub Repo Viewer

This project is a web application built with React and Tailwind CSS that allows users to search for GitHub repositories, view repository details, and see a list of issues with a pie chart visualization.

## Design Choices

- **React**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling due to its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid and consistent design.
- **React Router**: Implemented for client-side routing to navigate between different views.
- **Axios**: Used for making API requests to GitHub.
- **Material-UI DataGrid**: Utilized for creating a sophisticated data table with sorting, filtering, and pagination features.
- **Chart.js**: Integrated for visualizing data with a pie chart.
